# Seaplane Logo Quick Kit

In this repository you will find categorized folders that contain Seaplane IO
logos for use in partner marketing materials.

It’s important for all Seaplane partners to align with Seaplane IO, Inc.
trademark usage guidelines. This quick-kit reduces this to simple use of a
subset of Seaplane logos for common usage by partners.

## Branding Quick-Kit Information

Simple Partner use in your collateral:

* Full-Color Logo: "seaplane-colors.svg"
* On Dark Content/Background:  use "seaplane-white.svg" 
* On Light Content/Background: use "seaplane-black.svg"

You may use other logos within the Quick-Kit as appropriate to your materials.
Follow these rules when referring to Seaplane:

* use the full-color logo for most collateral, unless single color is a better
  fit to the background.
* use of "no text" logo except in first-use on collateral where 'seaplane.io'
  text should be included (subsequent uses can drop the text element logo)
* use SVG (vector) logo format whenever possible / supported; otherwise
  use provided PNG; do not radically resize images to fit a need 
* Refer to the company as "Seaplane" and always use a capitalized first letter
* When referring to Seaplane in legal/contract materials, use "Seaplane IO, Inc."
* Seaplane logo must be no smaller than comparable logos on the
  page/collateral in question.

Seaplane partners cannot use any Seaplane trademarks, trade names, logos,
written language, graphics, or images in any manner that isn’t expressly
authorized by Seaplane and outlined in this document. Partners also shouldn’t

without Seaplane’s prior written consent.

Full Seaplane Branding Guidelines are available upon request should the above
simple usage not meet your needs. Contact marketing@seaplane.io if you are
